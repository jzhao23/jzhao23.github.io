    I’m a Computer Science student at Stanford hacking around and trying to figure out my life and make the world a better place while I’m at it.
<br> <br>
I was born in in Shanghai, China. When I first moved to Austin, Texas at the age of 5, I was super excited about America. I got my first taste of freedom (literally) when, to my absolute delight, I found out that I was allowed to choose my own food from the lunch line. 
<br><br> 
Many amazing and interesting things have happened to me from that day on, here in the land of the free:
<ul>
    <li>Got sick of lunch lines (~6/7 years old) </li>
    <li>Learned how to speak English (just in time to complain about lunch lines)</li>
    <li>Didn’t make 6th grade basketball team, decided to relegate myself to academics instead</li>
</ul>
                
        
        And since that fateful day, I’ve been blessed with the opportunity to pursue a variety of interests and work on projects that I feel passionate about. While I’ve dabbled in a lot of different endeavors, I’m most passionate about the intersection of technology and politics. I’m fascinated by the potential for technology to improve civic life and accelerate democracy as well as uplift social and economic conditions. The point of this website is basically to find other awesome people to talk to / collaborate with, so scroll around if you’re interested!
